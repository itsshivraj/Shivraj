EMAScript: Sun (now Oracle) had a trademark on the name “JavaScript” (which led to Microsoft calling its JavaScript dialect “JScript”). Thus, when it came to standardizing the language, a different name had to be used. Instead, “ECMAScript” was chosen, because the corresponding standard is hosted by Ecma International (see below). In practice, the terms “ECMAScript” and “JavaScript” are interchangeable. If JavaScript means “ECMAScript as implemented by Mozilla and others” then the the former is a dialect of the latter. The term “ECMAScript” is also frequently used to denote language versions (such as ECMAScript 5).
